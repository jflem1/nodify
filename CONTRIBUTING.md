- If you want to create an example application that others can use to learn from, then [create an issue](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/issues/new?assignees=miroiu&labels=application&template=add_example_app.md&title=%5BApplication%5D) describing what your application is doing and if you need help with anything.
- The application you showcase can use any license.
